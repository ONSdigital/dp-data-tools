When one accesses the /data endpoint of any ONS web site page ...

(from Carl on 26th Jan 2021):
The returned json data is what is stored on disc behind zebedee.
Within the zebedee root directory there is a master directory that holds the structure of the website.
There will be a bunch of json files in this file structure, which is the json data you see on the /data endpoint.

(my question to Carl):
I looked at the directory of web content for my local zebedee and noticed that a good number of the json files
that are the /data returned thing contain a field called breadcrumbs[] which helps to explain why there are
certain links on the actual HTML web page.
However none of the json files for any page type returned in the response for any /data endpoint contain the
field breadcrumbs[].
I also noticed other fields in the stuff stored on disc that don't seem to appear in in the /data json response.

(from Carl on 27th Jan 2021):
There is a page object model in Zebedee. When the /data endpoint is hit, Zebedee will deserialise the json file
into the page model.
It doesn’t look like the page model contains the breadcrumb[], so I suspect this is where it’s getting lost.
I guess at some point we stopped reading the breadcrumb from the json file and must be building it dynamically.
Here is a link to the root package of the page model:
