Contributing guidelines
=======================

### Git workflow

* Create a feature branch from `master`, e.g. `feature/new-feature`
* Pull requests must contain a succinct, clear summary of what problem the new tool is going to solve
* Ensure your branch contains logical atomic commits before sending a pull request - follow the [alphagov Git styleguide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md)
